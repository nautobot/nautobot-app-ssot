"""Nautobot DiffSync models for OpenShift integration.

This module defines DiffSync models representing Nautobot objects that correspond to
OpenShift resources. These models handle the transformation and creation of Nautobot
objects from OpenShift data, providing the target side of the synchronization process.

Nautobot Object Mapping Strategy:
- OpenShift Projects/Namespaces → Nautobot Tenants (organizational grouping)
- OpenShift Nodes → Nautobot Devices (physical/virtual infrastructure)
- OpenShift Clusters → Nautobot Clusters (container orchestration platforms)
- KubeVirt VMs → Nautobot VirtualMachines (virtualized workloads)
- Pod/Service IPs → Nautobot IP Addresses (network resource tracking)
- OpenShift Services → Nautobot Services (network service definitions)

Data Model Integration:
- Utilizes Nautobot's existing DCIM and IPAM models
- Extends with custom fields for OpenShift-specific metadata
- Maintains referential integrity between related objects
- Supports tenant-based multi-tenancy and access control

DiffSync Integration Patterns:
- Create operations handle Nautobot object instantiation
- Update operations modify existing objects while preserving relationships
- Delete operations clean up dependent objects automatically
- Custom field synchronization preserves OpenShift metadata

Security and Access Control:
- Tenant assignment provides multi-tenancy isolation
- Status field management follows Nautobot lifecycle states
- Custom field validation ensures data integrity
- Audit trails track all synchronization activities

Performance Considerations:
- Bulk operations where possible to reduce database load
- Efficient lookups using proper field indexing
- Lazy loading of related objects to minimize queries
- Transaction management for consistency during sync operations

    Tenants in Nautobot provide organizational hierarchy and access control,

    OpenShift Project Mapping:

# =====================================================================
# NAUTOBOT INTEGRATION PATTERNS FOR MAINTENANCE DEVELOPERS
# =====================================================================
#
# 1. Object Relationship Mapping:
#    # OpenShift Namespace → Nautobot Tenant
#    tenant = NautobotTenant(
#        name="production",
#        description="Production environment",
#        custom_fields={"openshift_project_uid": "abc-123"}
#    )
#    
#    # OpenShift Node → Nautobot Device  
#    device = NautobotDevice(
#        name="worker-01.prod.local",
#        device_type="OpenShift Node",
#        device_role="OpenShift Worker",
#        site="datacenter-east",
#        primary_ip4="10.0.1.15/24",
#        custom_fields={"cpu_capacity": "8", "memory_capacity": "32Gi"}
#    )
#    
#    # KubeVirt VM → Nautobot VirtualMachine
#    vm = NautobotVirtualMachine(
#        name="web-server-vm",
#        cluster="prod-openshift-cluster",
#        vcpus=4,
#        memory=8192,  # 8GB in MB
#        primary_ip4="10.244.1.45/24",
#        custom_fields={"vm_uid": "xyz-789", "guest_os": "rhel8"}
#    )
#
# 2. Custom Field Utilization:
#    # Store OpenShift-specific metadata in custom fields
#    custom_fields = {
#        "openshift_namespace": "production",
#        "openshift_cluster": "prod-cluster-east",
#        "resource_version": "12345",
#        "last_sync_time": "2023-10-15T10:30:00Z",
#        "sync_source": "openshift-ssot"
#    }
#
# 3. Status Mapping:
#    def map_openshift_status_to_nautobot(openshift_status):
#        status_mapping = {
#            "Running": "Active",
#            "Stopped": "Offline",  
#            "Starting": "Staging",
#            "Failed": "Failed",
#            "Unknown": "Offline"
#        }
#        return status_mapping.get(openshift_status, "Offline")
#
# 4. Bulk Operations Pattern:
#    # Use bulk operations for performance
#    devices_to_create = []
#    for node_data in openshift_nodes:
#        device = Device(
#            name=node_data["name"],
#            device_type=adapter.openshift_device_type,
#            # ... other fields
#        )
#        devices_to_create.append(device)
#    
#    Device.objects.bulk_create(devices_to_create, batch_size=100)
#
# 5. Relationship Management:
#    # Handle object relationships properly
#    def create_vm_with_cluster(vm_data, cluster_name):
#        # Ensure cluster exists first
#        cluster, created = Cluster.objects.get_or_create(
#            name=cluster_name,
#            defaults={'cluster_type': openshift_cluster_type}
#        )
#        
#        # Create VM with cluster relationship
#        vm = VirtualMachine.objects.create(
#            name=vm_data["name"],
#            cluster=cluster,
#            # ... other fields
#        )
#        return vm
#
# =====================================================================
# SYNCHRONIZATION STRATEGIES
# =====================================================================
#
# 1. Create vs Update Logic:
#    def sync_tenant(openshift_project, nautobot_tenant=None):
#        if nautobot_tenant is None:
#            # Create new tenant
#            return NautobotTenant.create(adapter, ids, attrs)
#        else:
#            # Update existing tenant
#            return nautobot_tenant.update(attrs)
#
# 2. Dependency Ordering:
#    # Create objects in dependency order
#    sync_order = [
#        "tenants",      # First: organizational structure
#        "clusters",     # Second: infrastructure grouping
#        "devices",      # Third: physical/virtual nodes
#        "ip_addresses", # Fourth: network resources
#        "vms",          # Fifth: virtual machines
#        "services"      # Last: network services
#    ]
#
# 3. Error Handling:
#    try:
#        vm = NautobotVirtualMachine.create(adapter, ids, attrs)
#    except IntegrityError as e:
#        # Handle duplicate key violations
#        logger.warning(f"VM {ids['name']} already exists: {e}")
#    except ValidationError as e:
#        # Handle field validation errors
#        logger.error(f"Invalid VM data for {ids['name']}: {e}")
#
# 4. Cleanup Operations:
#    def cleanup_orphaned_objects():
#        # Remove objects no longer present in OpenShift
#        orphaned_vms = VirtualMachine.objects.filter(
#            custom_field_data__sync_source="openshift-ssot",
#            custom_field_data__last_sync__lt=current_sync_time
#        )
#        orphaned_vms.delete()
#
# =====================================================================
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION PATTERNS
# =====================================================================
#
# 1. Query Optimization:
#    # Use select_related for foreign key relationships
#    devices = Device.objects.select_related(
#        'device_type', 'device_role', 'site', 'platform'
#    ).filter(device_role__name='OpenShift Worker')
#
# 2. Batch Processing:
#    # Process large datasets in batches
#    from django.core.paginator import Paginator
#    
#    paginator = Paginator(openshift_nodes, 100)
#    for page_num in paginator.page_range:
#        page = paginator.page(page_num)
#        process_node_batch(page.object_list)
#
# 3. Transaction Management:
#    from django.db import transaction
#    
#    @transaction.atomic
#    def sync_namespace(namespace_data):
#        # All operations in single transaction
#        tenant = create_tenant(namespace_data)
#        devices = create_devices(namespace_data.nodes)
#        vms = create_vms(namespace_data.vms)
#        return tenant, devices, vms
#
# 4. Memory Management:
#    # Use iterators for large querysets
#    for device in Device.objects.filter(
#        device_role__name='OpenShift Worker'
#    ).iterator(chunk_size=100):
#        update_device_status(device)
#
