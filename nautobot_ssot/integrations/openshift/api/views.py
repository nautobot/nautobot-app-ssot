"""API views for OpenShift integration.

This module defines Django REST Framework ViewSets for the OpenShift SSoT
integration's API endpoints. ViewSets provide the business logic for handling
HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses for REST API operations.

Architecture:
- Built on Django REST Framework's ViewSet system
- Inherits from NautobotModelViewSet for consistency with Nautobot patterns
- Provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Integrates with filtering, pagination, and permission systems

Key Features:
- RESTful API endpoints following OpenAPI/Swagger standards
- Automatic HTTP method routing (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Built-in filtering and search capabilities
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Permission-based access control
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

HTTP Methods Supported:
- GET: Retrieve configuration(s) - list view and detail view
- POST: Create new configuration
- PUT: Complete update of existing configuration
- PATCH: Partial update of existing configuration  
- DELETE: Remove configuration
- OPTIONS: API metadata and field information

Security Features:
- Authentication required for all operations
- Permission checking at object and action levels
- Input validation using model constraints
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Rate limiting (configurable at Nautobot level)

API Response Format:
All responses follow Nautobot's standard API format with:
- Consistent JSON structure
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages with field-specific validation
- Metadata including pagination info
- Related object hyperlinks

Integration Benefits:
- Enables automation and Infrastructure-as-Code workflows
- Supports external system integrations
- Facilitates bulk operations and data management
- Provides programmatic access to all configuration features

    """REST API ViewSet for OpenShift configuration management.
    
    This ViewSet provides complete CRUD operations for OpenShift SSoT
    configurations via REST API. It follows Django REST Framework patterns
    and integrates seamlessly with Nautobot's API infrastructure.
    
    Inheritance from NautobotModelViewSet provides:
    - Standard REST API operations (list, create, retrieve, update, destroy)
    - Automatic HTTP method routing and URL pattern generation
    - Built-in filtering, searching, and pagination capabilities
    - Integration with Nautobot's permission system
    - Consistent error handling and response formatting
    - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
    
    Supported Operations:
    
    1. List Configurations (GET /api/plugins/nautobot-ssot/config/openshift/)
       - Returns paginated list of all configurations
       - Supports filtering by any model field
       - Includes search functionality across key fields
       - Provides total count and pagination metadata
    
    2. Create Configuration (POST /api/plugins/nautobot-ssot/config/openshift/)
       - Creates new OpenShift configuration
       - Validates all fields using model validation
       - Returns created object with assigned UUID
       - Triggers audit logging for the creation event
    
    3. Retrieve Configuration (GET /api/plugins/nautobot-ssot/config/openshift/{id}/)
       - Returns detailed view of specific configuration
       - Includes all model fields and relationships
       - Provides related object hyperlinks
       - Shows creation and modification timestamps
    
    4. Update Configuration (PUT/PATCH /api/plugins/nautobot-ssot/config/openshift/{id}/)
       - PUT: Complete replacement of configuration
       - PATCH: Partial update of specific fields
       - Validates changes using model validation
       - Triggers audit logging for modifications
    
    5. Delete Configuration (DELETE /api/plugins/nautobot-ssot/config/openshift/{id}/)
       - Removes configuration from system
       - Triggers audit logging for deletion
       - Returns 204 No Content on success
       - Handles cascading deletions appropriately
    
    Filtering and Search:
    - Query parameters: ?name=value, ?job_enabled=true, etc.
    - Search: ?q=searchterm (searches across key fields)
    - Ordering: ?ordering=name,-created (sort by fields)
    - Pagination: ?limit=20&offset=40 (control page size and position)
    
    Error Handling:
    - 400 Bad Request: Validation errors with field-specific messages
    - 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required
    - 403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions
    - 404 Not Found: Configuration doesn't exist
    - 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server errors
    
    Example API Usage:
    
    # List all configurations
    GET /api/plugins/nautobot-ssot/config/openshift/
    
    # Create new configuration
    POST /api/plugins/nautobot-ssot/config/openshift/
