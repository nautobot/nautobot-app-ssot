# Installing the App in Nautobot

Here you will find detailed instructions on how to **install** and **configure** the App within your Nautobot environment.

## Prerequisites

- The app is compatible with Nautobot 2.0.0 and higher.
- Databases supported: PostgreSQL, MySQL

!!! note
    Please check the [dedicated page](compatibility_matrix.md) for a full compatibility matrix and the deprecation policy.

!!! warning
    If upgrading from `1.x` version to `2.x` version of `nautobot-ssot` app, note that it now incorporates features previously provided by individual apps. For details, see the [upgrade guide](../admin/upgrade.md).

## Install Guide

!!! note
    Apps can be installed from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) or locally. See the [Nautobot documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/administration/installation/app-install/) for more details. The pip package name for this app is [`nautobot-ssot`](https://pypi.org/project/nautobot-ssot/).

The app is available as a Python package via PyPI and can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install nautobot-ssot
```

To use specific integrations, add them as extra dependencies:

```shell
# To install Cisco ACI integration:
pip install nautobot-ssot[aci]

# To install Arista CloudVision integration:
pip install nautobot-ssot[aristacv]

# To install all integrations:
pip install nautobot-ssot[all]
```

To ensure Single Source of Truth is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-ssot` package and any of the extras:

```shell
echo nautobot-ssot >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the app needs to be enabled in your Nautobot configuration. The following block of code below shows the additional configuration required to be added to your `nautobot_config.py` file:

- Append `"nautobot_ssot"` to the `PLUGINS` list.
- Append the `"nautobot_ssot"` dictionary to the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` dictionary and override any defaults.

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_ssot"]

# PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
#   "nautobot_ssot": {
#     "hide_example_jobs": True
#   }
# }
```

Once the Nautobot configuration is updated, run the Post Upgrade command (`nautobot-server post_upgrade`) to run migrations and clear any cache:

```shell
nautobot-server post_upgrade
```

Then restart (if necessary) the Nautobot services which may include:

- Nautobot
- Nautobot Workers
- Nautobot Scheduler

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker nautobot-scheduler
```

## App Configuration

The app behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings:

| Key                 | Example | Default | Description                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hide_example_jobs` | `True`  | `False` | A boolean to represent whether or not to display the example job. |

## Integrations Configuration

The `nautobot-ssot` package includes multiple integrations. Each requires extra dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.

Set up each integration using the specific guides:

- [Cisco ACI](./integrations/aci_setup.md)
- [Arista CloudVision](./integrations/aristacv_setup.md)
- [Device42](./integrations/device42_setup.md)
- [Cisco DNA Center](./integrations/dna_center_setup.md)
- [Infoblox](./integrations/infoblox_setup.md)
- [IPFabric](./integrations/ipfabric_setup.md)
- [ServiceNow](./integrations/servicenow_setup.md)
