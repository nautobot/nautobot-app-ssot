# Upgrading the App

## Upgrade Guide

When a new release comes out it may be necessary to run a migration of the database to account for any changes in the data models used by this plugin. Execute the command `nautobot-server post-upgrade` within the runtime environment of your Nautobot installation after updating the `nautobot-ssot` package via `pip`.
