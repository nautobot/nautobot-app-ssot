# Getting Started with the App

## Install the App

To install the App, please follow the instructions detailed in the [Installation Guide](../admin/install.md).

## First steps with the App

By default this plugin provides an example Data Source Job and example Data Target Job. You can run this example job to get a feel for the capabilities of the plugin.

However, to get the most out of this plugin you will want to find other existing Jobs and/or [create your own Jobs](./developing_jobs.md). Such Jobs can be installed like any other Nautobot Job:

* by [packaging into a Nautobot plugin](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/development/#including-jobs) which can then be installed into Nautobot's virtual environment
* by [inclusion in a Git repository](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/extras/gitrepository/#jobs) which can be configured in Nautobot and refreshed on demand
* by [manual installation of individual Job source files](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/additional-features/jobs/#writing-jobs) to Nautobot's `JOBS_ROOT` directory


Example screenshots of possible Data Sources and Data Targets are shown below.

Once you have other, more useful Jobs installed, these example Jobs can be disabled and removed from the UI by configuring `"hide_example_jobs"` to `True` in your `nautobot_config.py`:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_ssot": {
        "hide_example_jobs": True,
    }
}
```
